Read all Properties from ${user.home}/appname/dir1/dir2/abc_xyz.properties
Read empty Properties from ${user.home}/appname/dir1/dir2/appname_xyz.properties 
FINDING:  It seems that having one of the dir names in the file name causes 
the above unexpected result. 

Location of derby database
---------------------------
Location of derby database: derby.system.home is set to workingdir/derby_db

Properties loading logic
------------------------
For application with id: 'simplex'
PRODUCTION MODE Parent/Default (ReadOnly) properties are loaded from:
app = META-INF/simplex/configs/app.properties 
logging = META-INF/simplex/configs/logging.properties
settings = META-INF/simplex/configs/settings.properties
app auth = META-INF/simplex/configs/auth.properties
user auth = META-INF/simplex/configs/user_auth_[username].properties
jpa_jdbc = META-INF/simplex/configs/jpa_jdbc_[persistenceUnitName].properties

DEVELOPMENT MODE Parent/Default (ReadOnly) properties have names as above but suffixed with _devmode
E.g META-INF/simplex/configs/app.properties becomes META-INF/simplex/configs/app_devmode.properties

Read/Write properties are loaded from the working dir
e.g ${user.home}/simplex/configs/app.properties

App loading multiple levels of parent/default (ReadOnly) properties

Given an app with id: simplex with depends on library simplex_ui which in turn depends
on library simplex_core, default (ReadOnly) Properties could be loaded from all 
libraries if required. 

'simplex_core', 'simplex_ui', 'simplex'
